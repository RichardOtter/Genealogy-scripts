Un-split source scripts

Start with a specific group of sources. Can generalize it later, if desired.

Start with SSDI sources.
Have lots of them.

Can go thru them looking for srcs that have more than one citation.
Usually they can be merged into a blank citation. There was never much value in repeating info
from the source in the source detail field and have it print.

Source template is _SSDI: Ancestry.com
has fields-
Source Name
File Number
Subject
AccessDate

Source Text
Source Comment

Media
Repositories
Web Tags

New source Template
Make it specific for SSDI and SSACI
So use it to create 2 sources- SSDI and SSACI
