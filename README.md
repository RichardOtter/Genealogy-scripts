# Genealogy-scripts

These are scripts I've written to help with my
work with RootsMagic genealogy software.
They access the SQLite database used by RootsMagic (RM) to store its data.

These are currently all Python, tested only on Windows 11 OS.

Probably the most useful for others will be:

RM -Test external files
  A utility to check status of external files linked to a RootsMagic file.

RM -Switch source template
  A utility to switch the source template used by one or a set of sources.
  Preserves all linkages and allows remapping of field data.



These scripts are saved in GitHub as the simple .py text files. 
I have created single file exe versions, but haven't figured out 
how to distribute them.
