Some examples from DB

eg, me
I am PersonID	1
Maryann PersonID	2

Alban		3
Rose		4

Ferdinand	7
Agnes		8

Leonhard	9
Dorothea	10

FamilyTable
Alban & Rose
FamilyID = 125
FatherId = 3		PersonID
MotherID = 4		PersonID
ChildID = 1			

FamilyTable
Ferdinand & Agnes
FamilyID = 129
FatherId = 7
MotherID = 8
ChildID = 3

FamilyTable
Richard & Gloria
FamilyID = 127
FatherId = 1
MotherID = 6
ChildID = 2360

ChildTable
RecID = 797
ChildID = 1
FamilyID = 125

ChildTable
RecID = 748
ChildID = 3
FamilyID = 129

PersonTable
PersonID = 1
ParentID = 125
SpouseID =127

SpouseID points to 
FamilyID =127 
Richard & Gloria 
perople 1-6 
childID 2360  


ChildTable
RecID = 25
ChildID = 2360
