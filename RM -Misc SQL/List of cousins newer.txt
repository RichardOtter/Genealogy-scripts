removed on CE table- not needed,
renamed ancestorList to cousin_of_person
change DescendantID to CousinID



2 recursions- one to get ancestors, two to get descendants of each ancestor
only the first needs to be seeded with start person


ends with getting full list from 
cousin_of_person

ancestor_of_person
which is the start of recursion for ancestors

parent_of

child_of

Common Table expression pattern to define constants.
Get then by subquery " (SELECT C_BioParetOnly FROM constants)"

       WHERE
         CASE (SELECT C_BioParetOnly FROM constants )
         WHEN 1 THEN RelMother=0
         ELSE 1
         END

if C_BioParetOnly = 1 (true), then result of CASE is RelMother=0, and the clause is "WHERE RelMother=0"
if C_BioParetOnly = 0 (lalse), then result of CASE is 1, and the clause is "WHERE 1"  (no selection, all valid.)
