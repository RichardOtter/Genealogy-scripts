Update all files in local git repo - make sure main branch is correct.

For now, building from Main branch from local files


First test any changes to the build util scripts and configuration files.
Confirm old and current version numbers are correct.
BuildRelease.py
_top_level_build_config.yaml
_util_info.yaml

Confirm documentation correct, both the top level ReadMe in the doc folder
and the individulal ReadMe's for each utility.

Do a test run of the main build script in repo\dev util scripts

Run the main build script in dev util scripts:
BuildRelease.py
from its normal location


The Release Folder is created in the repo RM folder. A typical name is-
Release RM_Utilities_Suite_v1.0.2 2025-01-01_155604

If all OK-
push all code to github main


RELEASE PROCEDURE for GitHub
see build script output for git tag name, git release title and git commands


tag local with command line
write tag comment in default text editor, save and close.
(with notepad, must do an explicit save before quitting notepad.)

Perhaps mini release notes?

push tag with command line



That subfolder should be moved to the upper level Releases folder when done.

Draft a release at Github
  see build output for release Title
  Check previous title for pattern (use spaces in title, not in tag)
  Select the git tag in the drop down list
Add the zip file
Save as draft and let it sit and age for a while
Publish the release
Update website.
Write an announcement post to groups.
