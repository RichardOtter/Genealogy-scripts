Update all files in local git - make sure main branch is correct.

For now, building from Main branch from local files


First test any changes to the util scripts.
Confirm documentation correct


_top_level_build_config.yaml
readme.txt
_util_info.yaml

Do a test run of the main build script in dev util scripts:
BuildRelease.py

If all OK

push all code to github main


RELEASE PROCEDURE for GitHub
see build script output for git tag name, git release title and git commands


tag local with command line
write tag comment in default text editor, save and close.
(with notepad, must do an explicit save before quitting notepad.)

Perhaps mini release notes?

push tag with command line

Run the main build script in dev util scripts:
BuildRelease.py
from its normal location

It will create a subfolder -  
Release RM_Utilities_Suite_v1.0.2 2025-02-01_202626

That subfolder should be moved to the upper level Releases folder when done.

Draft a release at Github
  see build output for release Title
  Check previous title for pattern (use spaces in title, not in tag)
  Select the git tag in the drop down list
Add the zip file
Save as draft and let it sit and age for a while
Publish the release
Update website.
Write an announcement post to groups.
