Build script
Added a Hardlink of the python build script used by projects
BuildRelease.py
along with the requires _util_info.yaml file.

All copies in the util folders are hardlinks of this file.
This will be the model, and should be kept up to date.

DB  local copy maintenance

DB reset test db.cmd
DB get fresh copy.cmd

2 Windows command scripts to allow easy replacement of the local copy of the
 master database with a fresh copy or from the local backup.

The local copies have the name of the 2 higher folder name, 
usually the script folder name to distinguish the file names
