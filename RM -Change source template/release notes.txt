Fixed a bug seen when old field had a trailing space in name,
Couldn't map it to a new name.

Better parsing of mapping fields.
Change in the config file format-
Separate ou the source and citation mappings into a new section.
Now need a > between mapping columns

Better error handling
Refactored out common code into a python package.
