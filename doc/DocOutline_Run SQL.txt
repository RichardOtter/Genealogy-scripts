Run SQL commands on a RootsMagic database
RunSQL.py
INCLUDE: LIB_INTRO
=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

This utility will run SQL statements and script files on a database 
and display the results in a text file.

This utility is meant to help the novice SQL user get the task done.
It attempts to eliminate most of the complications found using more
sophisticated off the shelf SQLite manager software.

The ability to run SQL script files can be used by even advanced users to
run database maintenance scripts which give predictable results and
don't need to show output.

==========-
*  Copy these items from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      RunSQL.py                        (file)
      RM-Python-config.ini             (file)
      RMpy                             (folder)

==========-
*  Download the SQLite extension file: unifuzz64.dll   -see below
   (This dll provides a RMNOCASE collation used by RM.)
   Move the unifuzz64.dll file to the working folder.

INCLUDE: LIB_STEPS_2

The utility also needs to know where the unifuzz64.dll file is.  Its path
is give an the value of the key RMNOCASE.

Save the config file but leave it open in Notepad.
You will now be editing additional settings.

=========-
Enter your SQL statement into the config file using key-value pairs in the
[SQL] section of the file.

The utility will run up to 99 SQL statements. They are written in the config
file as, for example:

[SQL]
SQL_STATEMENT_1 = SELECT PersonID FROM PersonTable;


This section "SQL" has one key: "SQL_STATEMENT_1" which has the
value "SELECT PersonID FROM PersonTable;".

This example, if run with the utility, will run the very simple SQL statement
and print out all of the RINs in the database.
The example SQL text is very simple and fits on the same line as the key name.
Real SQL will be more complex and require multiple lines for human readability.

Each line of a multi line Value must be indented at least one space.
For example:

[SQL]
SQL_STATEMENT_1 =
    -- simple example sql
    SELECT Given
    FROM NameTable
    WHERE Surname LIKE 'smith';

The SQL_STATEMENT_1  key specifies the SQL statement that will be run.
The statement may begin on the next line, as above, as long as the SQL lines
are all indented with white space. Blank lines are not allowed.
Use indented SQL comments (--) to add spacing for readability.
# style comments are not allowed within multi line values.

Note that the SQL_STATEMENT_1 key is required, while additional SQL_STATEMENTs 
are optional.

The the app will accept up to 99 SQL statements.-
   SQL_STATEMENT_1
   SQL_STATEMENT_2
   ...
   SQL_STATEMENT_99

This app will also run SQL script files. In this case, the file path is
specified, not the contents.
For example:

[SQL]
SQL_SCRIPT_1 = Maintenance-auto.sql

For this key, always place the file path on the same line as the key name,
as shown in the example.
To specify a second script file to run, add in another key name as:

SQL_SCRIPT_2 =  C:\my script folder\SecondScriptFile.sql

Up to 99 scripts can be run.

If you want none of the SQL Statements to run, just change the name of 
SQL_STATEMENT_1  to anything else, such as:
INACTIVE_SQL_STATEMENT_1 
Since the SQL_STATEMENT_1  won't be found, none of the other SQL_STATEMENTs 
will run.

Same for SQL script file keys. Renaming SQL_SCRIPT_1 will stop any scripts 
from running.


===========-
Database modification statements should usually be followed by a
SELECT changes(); statement to display how many rows were changed.


This utility will not help you write the SQL statement and is not a good
working environment in which to create your SQL statement.
Confirm you query works before running it in this utility. (Or get the SQL from
a source that has verified its results.)

=========-
Confirm the config file has the proper entries and that is has been saved.

=========-
Double click the "RunSQL.py" file in the working folder
to start the utility.

=========-
A terminal window is momentarily displayed while the utility processes
the commands.

=========-
The terminal window is closed and the utility is exited.

=========-
The report file is displayed in Notepad for you inspection.

=========-
IMPORTANT:
See notes below regarding SQL that refers to or updates column data collated by
the RMNOCASE collation.

=========-
Open the TEST.rmtree database in RM and confirm the desired changes have
been accomplished.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Notes

This utility optionally loads the collation sequence RMNOCASE from the 
unifuzz64.dll file.  That means that the RMNOCASE collation, used in many RM
tables is available if the RMNOCASE key is set to the location of unifuzz64.dd.
However, the collation sequence in unifuzz64 is not identical to the one in the
RM application. Problems arise when accessing indexes created with one
collation with SQL using the other.

=========-
If your SQL makes any **changes** to an RMONCASE collated column, you must
run the SQL:
REINDEX RMNOCASE;
as SQL_STATEMENT_1 or at the start of your script file.
Put your updating SQL in following statements.

RootsMagic must be closed when the SQL is run.

After running the SQL, run the RM "Rebuild Indexes" tool immediately after
opening the modified database in RM.
From Left hand icon panel, select the Tools icon to open the Tools listing,
then select Database Tools=>Rebuild indexes=>Run selected tool.

Queries that use but do not modify RMONCASE collated columns have two options-
1- do as above, first REINDEX RMNOCASE and then Rebuild indexes in RM
or
2 code the SQL to use the SQLite built-in NOCASE collation as an override 
to the RMNOCASE.

=========-
On some occasions, the utility terminal window will display a "Database
Locked" message. In that case: Close the terminal window, Close RM and re-run
the utility, then re-open RM.
"Database locked" is a normal message encountered with SQLite.

TODO

*  Consider adding execution of SQL scripts.
*  Consider fancier formatting of output.
*  Add ability to add additional database extensions besides RMNOCASE.
*  ?? what would you find useful?
