Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software (https://RootsMagic.com) uses a SQLite relational
database (https://sqlite.org) as its data storage file.

Access to the RM data file via third party tools is a major advantage RM
has over other genealogy project management applications.

This utility is part of a suite of utilities that has been written to
perform analysis or data modification not available within the RM application.
See https://RichardOtter.github.io

This software is written using the Python language (https://Python.org) and
is distributed as a text ".py" file along with a folder, RMpy, of common Python
code, called a python package. The user can simply open the file or package
files in a text editor to read all implementation details and assess safety.

A Python py script file is executed using the Python language interpreter.
The interpreter is a separate piece of software easily installed on your
computer. "Installing python" is described in the appendix below.


=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_Compatibility
Compatibility

Tested with a RootsMagic v 11.0.3 database
using Python for Windows v3.14   64bit

The python script file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be
modified to work on a Macintosh with Python version 3.n installed.

=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_Backups large changes
Backups

VERY IMPORTANT
This utility makes changes to the RM database file. It can change a large number
of data items in a single run depending on the parameters specified.
You will likely not be satisfied with your first run of the utility and you will
want to try again, perhaps several times, each time making changes to your
configuration file.
You must run this script on a copy of your database file or have at least
multiple known-good backups.

Read about additional considerations in the Precautions section below.

LIB_Backups small changes
Backups

IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file (or at least
have multiple known-good backups) until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.

=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_Backups read only
Backups

IMPORTANT
This script only reads the database file and makes no changes.
However, you should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the the database
remains intact after use. At that point, run this utility of your
"production" database.

=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_Overview
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility".
It is in the form of a single text file with a "py" file name extension
(referred to, in this section, as "MainScriptFile.py"). The utility also
needs the Python package RMpy, which is a folder included in the distribution
zip file.

Input to the utility is through the configuration file and. for some of the
utilities, the command terminal.
The the default name of the configuration file (called, hereinafter, the
"config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini". It should be located in the same
folder as the MainScriptFile py file and the RMpy folder. At a minimum, the config
file gives the name and location of the database on which the utility operates.

One config file can be shared among other RM utilities in the suite. Each
utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see "APPENDIX  Python install" below.

*  Create a new folder on your computer, perhaps within your home folder.
   This folder will be called the "working folder".

   (Your home folder is "C:\Users\me", where "me" is your user name.
   This is a safe location that will not be taken over by OneDrive.)

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy the program files/folder from the downloaded zip file to
   the working folder.

*  Copy the sample config file from the downloaded zip file to
   the working folder.

*  Edit the config file in the working folder to tell the utility what to
   do and where to do it.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile .py file to run the utility.

*  A window titled "Command Prompt" with a black background and white text will
appear. Some utilities will keep this window open and request commands and
information, other utilities will only show the window for a moment, others
will have the window displayed for the length of the utility's processing time.

*  The terminal window will close and a summary report will be displayed
in NotePad.

The above procedure of making a copy of your database and operating on it in
the working folder is most prudent when a user is just getting familiar with
a new or updated utility.

Some utilities are read only and do not change the database at all, while others
affect only small amount of data. Once the user has confidence in the operation
of such a low-impact utility, one can start operating directly on the research
(production) database, always assuming that at least several known-good backups
exist.

Other utilities that involve more configuration and make larger changes should
always operate on databases copied into a working folder.

LIB_APPENDIX  Database with external file links from a new location
APPENDIX  Using a database with external file links from a new directory location

RM finds media files linked to a database by several methods. In my opinion, 
the method to find all media files in the Media Folder, as specified in the RM
Preferences, is the most reliable, but the other methods can certainly be
useful in come circumstances.
One of the  other"search methods" is to find a file by noting it location in
relation to the database file. This is fine unless the database file is moved
and the files are not.
This point needs to be made in regards to the instructions for testing the
utility app described here. When you make a copy of your database and move the
copy to the "Working folder", as instructed above, some of the database's 
external files may not be found when running the database in the new location.
This is only temporary. Move the database back to it's original location and
the media files will be found again.
So, while the database is in its temporary test location, don't be alarmed to
see red X's on media file thumbnails. Don't try to fix the links until you have
returned the database to its usual directory location.

=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing
APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The utility requires a configuration file. A file named "RM-Python-config.ini"
will be recognized as the utility's configuration file when placed in the same
directory as the MainScriptFile py file for the utility. Each utility is
distributed with a sample config file to get you started.

"MainScriptFile.py" refers to the py file having the name of the utility you
are running, for example, TestExternalFiles.py, ChangeSourceTemplate.py etc

Alternatively, the configuration file name and location can be specified
on the command-line as an argument to the script. This argument overrides
the default configuration file name and location.

For example, if the script "MainScriptFile.py" is executed from a terminal window
which has the folder "C:\Users\me\TestFolder" as its 'current directory', it
will use the configuration file "C:\Users\me\TestFolder\RM-Python-config.ini"
if it exists. If the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
MainScriptFile.py "C:\Users\me\Documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified ini configuration file will be used instead.

Note also that the file name is not restricted to the default.
For instance, running the utility from a terminal window as:
MainScriptFile.py config_mine.ini
will instruct the utility to use config_mine.ini in the current directory
as its configuration file.

A configuration file that is used from the command line can be renamed so as
to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described script name
with config file name argument to allow execution from the desktop with a
double mouse click.


Editing
Use any text editor to edit the configuration file. The Windows built-in
app "Notepad" is suitable.
To edit the configuration file, first open the Notepad app and then use the
mouse to drag the configuration file onto the open Notepad window.
(By default, files with the .ini extension are not associated with an
editor program.)


Format and conventions
The config file uses the standard ini file format. The config file is made up
of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and Comments.

A name in square brackets is a section name that identifies the start
of a section. A section continues until a new section starts. The order of
sections is a config file is not important, but all of the sample config files
start with the [FILE_PATHS] section.

A section contains one or more key-value pairs and comment lines. Every key
should be in a named section.

A name on the left side of a "=" sign is a key.
Text on the right side of a "=" is the value assigned to the key on the left.
Comment lines start with a "#" character and are only included to help
the human user read and understand the file. They are ignored by the utility
software. Comments may appear anywhere in the config file EXCEPT in multi line
values. See below.

For an example, here is a section containing 3 key-values used by all of the
RM utilities:

[FILE_PATHS]
# this is the test database
DB_PATH         = TEST.rmtree
REPORT_FILE_PATH  = ..\Report_utilName.txt
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP  = C:\Windows\system32\Notepad.exe

The 3 keys, DB_PATH, REPORT_FILE_PATH, and REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP are all
in the [FILE_PATHS] section. The utility requires that their values be file
paths, as shown.
The second line is a comment.

The file path may be absolute, as in REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP above, or it may
be relative to the current directory, as in DB_PATH and REPORT_FILE_PATH above.

The DB_PATH points to the database that is to be analyzed/modified.
See the sections "Backups" and "Running the utility in detail", above, for help
in deciding which database to use. New users will always want to point to a
copy of the main database.

The utilities all generate a report file. The file's name and location can be
specified by REPORT_FILE_PATH key.

If REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP key has a valid value, then the report file will be
automatically displayed by the named application.


=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_APPENDIX  Config File: multi-line value
multi-line value

The ini file format used by the config file allows entry of multi-line values.
These are used when the key is to be assigned more than a single name or datum.
The multi line value is still just one value, but the values is split up into
multiple lines.

Each line of a value after the first, must be indented with at least one
space character.

All the lines in a value should have the same indentation. Not required but
looks much more tidy and is easier to read.

There must be one or more blank lines at the end of a value separating it
from the next key or section marker or comment.

Comment lines are not allowed within a multi-line value.

Examples-

correct formats-

KEY_NAME1 = item1

KEY_NAME2 =
  item1

KEY_NAME3 = item1
  item2
  item3

KEY_NAME4 =
  item1
  item2
  item3

LIB_APPENDIX  Config File: multi-line value SQL
=========-
Multiline Values

Probably the trickiest part of the config file is the SQL section.
The SQL_STATEMENT_1, SQL_STATEMENT_2 etc keys are multi-line values.
Each line of the value should be on a separate line indented with at least
one blank. An empty line terminates the value/statement.
generates an error.
Multi-line values may not contain # style comment lines, but they may
contain -- style SQL comments. These are just part of the value/statement.

examples-

===========-
correct format-
[SQL]
SQL_STATEMENT_1 =
   SELECT pt.PersonId
   FROM PersonTable AS pt

LIB_APPENDIX  Config File: Mapping value
MAPPING_ value format

Values that this utility names "MAPPING_" have additional format requirements.

Each line must have 2 names- old field name and new field name, separated by
a ">" character.
The word "NULL" may substitute for either old or new field name.

Names may be enclosed in double quotes.  Quotes are required when a name
contains a blank or ">" character at the beginning, end, or anywhere within it.

The white space between the names and ">" character is ignored.


=========================================================================DIV80==
LIB_APPENDIX  Config File: encoding
Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented ä in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

LIB_APPENDIX  Troubleshooting
APPENDIX  Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the terminal window for error messages
that will help you fix the problem. There may be something wrong with the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH.

If the terminal windows displays the message: RM-Python-config.ini file contains
a format error, see the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console, cd'ing to
the folder containing the py file and then running the py file from the
command line. The window will not close and you will be able to read any
error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Examine the file visually and check to see that it follows the rules mentioned
above. If all else fails, start over with the supplied config file and make
sure that it works, Then make your edits one by one to identify the problem.

LIB_Precautions before using the modified database
Precautions before using the modified database

Once you are satisfied with the results of the modifications made by this
software, don't hurry to start using the resulting file for research.
Continue your work for several days using the original database to allow
further thought. Then run the utility again with your perfected config
file on a new copy of your now-current database. Inspect the results and then
use the modified database as your normal research file.

The week delay will give you time to think about what could go wrong. You should
consider unexpected changes to your data that you did not want.

If you start using the newly modified database immediately, you'll lose work
if you missed a problem only to find it later and have to revert to a backup
from before the database was modified.
