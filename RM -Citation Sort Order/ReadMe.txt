CitationSortOrder

Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third party tools is a major advantage
to using RM.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

This utility will charge the order that citations are listed in the Edit Person
window for citations attached to Facts, Names and/or Persons. This may be helpful
while doing research in bringing the most important citations to the top of the list.
The new ordering of citations is not used in reports.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

IMPORTANT: You should run this script on a copy of your database file until you
have confidence using it and confidence in its results. Or at least have a
current known-good backup.


CAUTION
This utility is using an undocumented feature of the RootsMagic (RM) application.
It is possible that a future release of RootsMagic may ignore the changes made
by this utility. It may also be possible, but highly unlikely, that a future RM
release may not work with a database whose citation sort order has been changed
with this utility. Fortunately, all changes made by this utility can be reverted by
a single, simple SQL update statement. See Notes.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic version 10.
Not compatible with ver 7.

.exe file version
       Windows 64bit only. Tested with Windows 11.

.py file version
       Tested with Python for Windows v3.12   64bit
       The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
       modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". To install and use
the exe single file version:

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Copy these files from downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      CitationSortOrder.exe
      RM-Python-config.ini

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Edit the supplied text file named "RM-Python-config.ini". (Hereinafter
   referred to, as the "config file".)
   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located and the output
   report file name and location.
   If you followed the above instructions, no edits are needed.

*  Double click the CitationSortOrder file. This displays the black command
   console window.

3:  The console window displays a prompt asking for the RIN
(PersonID) of the person that has the attached citation list.
The utility will continue with prompts until the desired list of citations is
displayed. The user then responds to prompts until the list is ordered in the
desired way. The utility will then close.

4:  Return to the RootsMagic application window. Navigate away from the changed
citation listing and the return to it. Examine the modified sort order.

Use the py script file.  See section below, after the Notes section, entitled-
"Which to use? Standalone .exe file or .py file"

NOTES

===========================================DIV50==
CitationSortOrder can change the sort order for citations attached to Person,
Names, and Facts.
Currently, this utility will not change the sort order of citations attached to
Tasks, Marriages & Associations.
Those capabilities could be added.
This utility only changes the database table: CitationLinkTable and within
it, only the SortOrder column..

===========================================DIV50==
Use of this utility may be productively combined with the use of a global
re-ordering SQL script developed by Tom Holden and Jerry Bryan.
https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/forum/topic/sorting-the-order-of-rm9-citations/

===========================================DIV50==
Due to lack of support in the RM app, the modified sort order is not utilized
in the "slide in" workflow for facts or in reports generated by RM.

===========================================DIV50==
Note that after reordering, newly added citations will appear at the top
of the list as they will have a SortOrder number of 0.
This contrasts with behavior seen before reordering where the citations are shown
in "order entered" sequence because all records are added with a SortOrder number of 0.
Use this app to make desired changes.

===========================================DIV50==
Updating the sort order of a set of citations while the database is open in
RM works OK. However, the citation lists do not have a refresh button, so,
you'll need to navigate away from the modified sort order citation list and then
return to it to see the new sort order.

===========================================DIV50==
To revert all citation sort order modifications made by this utility, simply
change the sort order column to all zeros.
UPDATE CitationLinkTable SET SortOrder = 0;
This will change the sort order in RM v10 to "order entered", which is
the default.

===========================================DIV50==
RM-Python-config.ini  (the config file)
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.

File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

config file path names may be absolute or relative to the current directory.

===========================================DIV50==
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP
Option to automatically open the report file in a display application.
The included ini sample file has this option activated and set to use Windows
NotePad as the display app. Your favorite editor may be substituted.
Automatic display can be deactivated by inserting a # character
at the start of the line.

Troubleshooting:

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There is probably something wrong with the config file line-
REPORT_FILE_PATH

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

The problem is as stated, the solution may be harder to determine.
Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
You may want to look at- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

A reason that report file cannot be generated is if the specified REPORT_FILE_PATH
cannot be created.
The default value in the supplied config file should always work.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the exe or py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

Which to use? Standalone .exe file or .py file

Decide whether you wish to use the script file (.py) or the executable
file (.exe) version. They produce exactly the same output at the same speed.
Using one does not preclude using the other.

Pro's and Con's

*   The .exe Executable File Version
  Pro:
   The single exe file is all you need. No need to install Python.
  Con:
   The exe file is not human readable.
   A certain amount of trust is required to run a program not distributed
   by a major software publisher. Unknown software from an untrusted source
   could contain mal-ware. Rely on reviews by other users to establish trust.
   Only use the exe file that you downloaded from GitHub.com yourself.

--- OR ---

*   The .py Script File Version
  Pro:
   The script file is easily readable and one can confirm what it does.
   You may want to learn Python and make your own changes to the script
   and be able to use other scripts.
  Con:
   The script version requires an installation of the Python environment to run.
   This is a 100 MB investment in disk space. (Not big for modern day hard disks)



=========================================================================DIV80==
To use the py script version of the app

To install and use the script file version:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      CitationSortOrder.py
      RM-Python-config.ini
      RMpy

See the Overview section for the subsequent tasks.
