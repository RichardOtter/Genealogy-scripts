Save External Files/ Media Files Information to RM Database
ExternalFilesInfo.py


Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software (https://RootsMagic.com) uses a SQLite relational
database (https://sqlite.org) as its data storage file.

Access to the RM data file via third party tools is a major advantage RM
has over other genealogy project management applications.

This utility is part of a suite of utilities that has been written to
perform analysis or data modification not available within the RM application.
See https://RichardOtter.github.io

This software is written using the Python language (https://Python.org) and
is distributed as a text ".py" file along with a folder, RMpy, of common Python
code, called a python package. The user can simply open the file or package
files in a text editor to read all implementation details and assess safety.

A Python py script file is executed using the Python language interpreter.
The interpreter is a separate piece of software easily installed on your
computer. "Installing python" is described in the appendix below for Windows
computers. MacOS computers already have it installed.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose
This app retrieves information about all RootsMagic (RM) Media files and stores the
information in the RM database file. Media files, in RM lingo, are the files
linked to your family tree by RM but stored external to the database.
The app creates a new table in the RM database named AuxMultimediaTable.
The data currently saved are each file's-
Size
Creation Date
Modification Date
Hash value

I may be the only RM user that feels having this information in the database is 
a good idea. I think it is useful to keep tack of changes to external files,
helps in the event of a restoration of a backup, and ensures integrity of the 
link to external data.
=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file (or at least
have multiple known-good backups) until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with a RootsMagic v 11.0.4 database
using Python for Windows v3.14   64bit

The python script file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be
modified to work on a Macintosh with Python version 3.n installed.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Performance
A full check of the saved MD5 hash against the hash of the files found on disk
can take some time. My 7,000 files take about 2 minutes.
=========================================================================DIV80==
General Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". It is in the form of a
single text file with a "py" file name extension ("MainScriptFile.py") along
with the package "RMpy" which is a folder included in the distribution zip file. 
The MainScriptFile relies on code in the RMpy folder.
These utilities are not installed in the traditional Windows sense, they are
simply copied to the computer.

The utilities are configured by editing a configuration file. This
configuration tells the utility which database to use and how to display the output.
(Some of the utilities use the command terminal to interact with the user.)
The default name of the configuration file (called, hereinafter, the
"config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini". It should be located in the same
folder as the MainScriptFile.py file and the RMpy folder.

To install and use the utility for the first time (specifics below):

*  Install Python for Windows x64.

*  Create a new folder on your computer, the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.

*  Copy the required files from the downloaded zip file to the working folder.

*  Edit the config file in the working folder to tell the utility what to
   do and where to do it.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile.py file to run the utility.

*  A window (terminal window) with a black background and white text will appear.
Some utilities will keep this window open and request data, other utilities will
only show the window while the command is processing.

*  The terminal window will close and a summary report will be displayed
in NotePad.

The above procedure of making a copy of your database and operating on it in
the working folder is most prudent when a user is just getting familiar with
a new or updated utility.

Some utilities are read only and do not change the database at all, while others
affect only small amount of data.
Once the user has confidence in the operation of a low-impact utility, one
can start operating directly on the research (production) database, always
assuming that at least several known-good backups exist.

Other utilities that require more configuration and make larger changes should
always operate on databases copied into a working folder.

*****  Details follow below. *****

=========================================================================DIV80==
Running the utility - step by step

The steps listed here run the utility on a copy of your database created in a
new directory location. Once you feel comfortable with how the app operates,
you will want to run the app on your production database in its usual
folder location.

==========-
Install Python for Windows x64  -see "APPENDIX  Python install" below.

==========-
Create a folder on your computer that you will not confuse with other
folders. It will be referred to as the "working folder".

You may want to create it within your home folder. Your home folder is
"C:\Users\me", where "me" is your user name. This is a safe location that will
not be taken over by OneDrive.

==========-
Copy these items from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      ExternalFileInfo.py              (file)
      RM-Python-config.ini             (file)
      RMpy                             (folder)

==========-
Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.

Rename the database copy to "TEST.rmtree" in order to prevent any
confusion about the purpose of the copy.

==========-
Edit the sample RM-Python-config.ini file in the working folder.
(See the section "APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing"
if you need help)

A summary of the config file structure:
The names in square brackets are section names.
The items in a section are key-value pairs.

For example, in the sample config file, there is a section named [FILE_PATHS].
In that section, reside several key-value pairs, one of which is 
DB_PATH = TEST.rmtree

"DB_PATH" is the key, "TEST.rmtree" is the value. key-value pairs are separated
with an equals sign character.

The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
report file name and its location.

If you followed the above instructions, no changes to any of the key-values in
the [FILE_PATHS] section are needed.

==========-
Look at the [OPTIONS] section of the config file containing keys for the 
parameters needed to describe the desired changes:

EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD_FAST = off
EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD = off
EXTERNALFILESINFO_UPDATE = off
EXTERNALFILESINFO_COMPARE = on

Leave these alone for now.
Full details of how to specify the parameters are in the Notes section below.

==========-
Save the config file but leave it open in Notepad.

=========-
Double click the "ExternalFilesInfo.py" file in the working folder
to start the utility.

=========-
A terminal window is momentarily displayed while the utility processes
the commands.

=========-
The terminal window closes and the report file is displayed in Notepad for
your inspection.

=========-
The TEST.rmtree database has not actually been changed. You should see a message
in the report file stating:
ERROR==== The Aux table has not been added.
    Run again in ADD mode to create the table and populate it.

This is expected.
Now that you have run the app, go back to the config file and change the options to-
EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD_FAST = off
EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD = on
EXTERNALFILESINFO_UPDATE = off
EXTERNALFILESINFO_COMPARE = off

You have changed the run mode to "ADD". 
Double click the "ExternalFilesInfo.py" file in the working folder
to start the utility.

This time, the new Aux table is created in the database and the media files are
each examined and their properties are stored in the database.

(Note- you may get a message about missing files. This can happen because
this test database is not in the same location as the main production database.
There is more info in the appendix-)

=========-
After confirming that your database is intact, consider whether to ru the
utility on your main production database



=========================================================================DIV80==
Notes
Currently, only MD5 hashes are supported. This app does not need to be
cryptographically secure so MD5 should suffice. A mre secure hash will just slow
down processing.

Run modes explained
Only one mode may be set to on at a time for each ru of the app.

EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD = on
the mode that is used to add the new table to the database and add information
for all of you files.
This mode will also list files whose properties have changed since they were
added to the database.

EXTERNALFILESINFO_ADD_FAST = on
This is the mode you will use most often.
It only adds information for files that have been added to RM since the last
time this utility has been run.
It only calculates the hash for new files and therefore runs faster than ADD mode.

EXTERNALFILESINFO_COMPARE = on
This is the read only mode that you first ran.
It makes no changes. It will only compare the information isn the database 
with the information found by looking at the files on disk.

EXTERNALFILESINFO_UPDATE = on
This mode will list files whose properties have changed since they were
added to the database. It will then update the database with the new data about
any file that has changed.
Be sure to save this report because if you run tha app again after this update,
the discrepancies will have been eliminated.

APPENDIX  Using a database with external file links from a new directory location

RM finds media files linked to a database by several methods. In my opinion, 
the most reliable method to find all media files in the Media Folder, as 
specified in the RM Preferences. The other methods can certainly be
useful in some circumstances.
One of the  other"search methods" is to find a file by recording it location in
relation to the database file. This is fine unless the database file is moved
and the files are not.
This point needs to be made in regards to the instructions for testing the
utility app described here. When you make a copy of your database and move the
copy to the "Working folder", as instructed earlier, some of the database's 
external files may not be found when running the database in the new location.
This is only temporary. Move the database back to it's original location and
the media files will be found again.
So, while the database is in its temporary test location, don't be alarmed to
see red X's on media file thumbnails. Don't try to fix the links until you have
returned the database to its usual directory location.

APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The utility requires a configuration file. A file named "RM-Python-config.ini"
will be recognized as the utility's configuration file when placed in the same
directory as the MainScriptFile py file for the utility. Each utility is
distributed with a sample config file to get you started.

"MainScriptFile.py" refers to the py file having the name of the utility you
are running, for example, TestExternalFiles.py, ChangeSourceTemplate.py etc

Alternatively, the configuration file name and location can be specified
on the command-line as an argument to the script. This argument overrides
the default configuration file name and location.

For example, if the script "MainScriptFile.py" is executed from a terminal window
which has the folder "C:\Users\me\TestFolder" as its 'current directory', it
will use the configuration file "C:\Users\me\TestFolder\RM-Python-config.ini"
if it exists. If the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
MainScriptFile.py "C:\Users\me\Documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified ini configuration file will be used instead.

Note also that the file name is not restricted to the default.
For instance, running the utility from a terminal window as:
MainScriptFile.py config_mine.ini
will instruct the utility to use config_mine.ini in the current directory
as its configuration file.

A configuration file that is used from the command line can be named so as
to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described script name
with config file name argument to allow execution from the desktop with a
double mouse click.

Editing
Use any text editor to edit the configuration file. The Windows built-in
app "Notepad" is suitable.
To edit the configuration file, first open the Notepad app and then use the
mouse to drag the configuration file onto the open Notepad window.
(By default, files with the .ini extension are not associated with an
editor program.)

Format and conventions
The config file uses the standard ini file format. The config file is made up
of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and Comments.

A name in square brackets is a section name that identifies the start
of a section. A section continues until a new section starts. The order of
sections is a config file is not important, but all of the sample config files
start with the [FILE_PATHS] section.

A section contains one or more key-value pairs and comment lines. Every key
should be in a named section.

A name on the left side of a "=" sign is a key.
Text on the right side of a "=" is the value assigned to the key on the left.
Comment lines start with a "#" character and are only included to help
the human user read and understand the file. They are ignored by the utility
software. Comments may appear most anywhere in the config file.

For an example, here is a section containing 3 key-values used by all of the
RM utilities:

[FILE_PATHS]
# this is the test database
DB_PATH         = TEST.rmtree
REPORT_FILE_PATH  = ..\Report_utilName.txt
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP  = C:\Windows\system32\Notepad.exe

[OPTIONS]
UPPER_CASE = on

The 3 keys, DB_PATH, REPORT_FILE_PATH, and REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP are all
in the [FILE_PATHS] section. The UPPER_CASE key is in the OPTIONS section.
The second line is a comment.

=========-
Keys used by all of the utilities.
DB_PATH, REPORT_FILE_PATH, REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

See "APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing" for more general
editing information.

These keys all appear in the [FILE_PATHS] section of the config file.

DB_PATH     =  TEST.rmtree
DB_PATH     =  my TEST database.rmtree
DB_PATH     =  my database folder\TEST.rmtree
DB_PATH     =  ..\..\TEST.rmtree
DB_PATH     =  Y:\weird drive\TEST.rmtree

Specifies the file path to the RM database to be analyzed.
The path may be an absolute or relative path.
Leading an trailing white space is ignored.

REPORT_FILE_PATH         = Report.txt
REPORT_FILE_PATH         = ..\Report.txt

The name and path to the report file generated for each run.
This path must be writeable.
An existing file will be overwritten.
The path may be absolute or relative path.
Leading an trailing white space is ignored

REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP  = C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe

The application used to display the report at the end of the run.
If this key is not given (say, the line is commented out), then the report is
generated but not displayed.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented ä in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Note: by default, the Python installer places the software in the user's
home folder in the standard location.

A Python installation requires about 100 Mbytes.
It is easily and cleanly removed using the standard Windows method found in
Windows=>Settings=>Installed apps

=========================================================================DIV80==
APPENDIX  Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the terminal windows displays the message: RM-Python-config.ini file contains
a format error, see the section below.

If no report file is generated, look at the terminal window for error messages
that will help you fix the problem. There may be something wrong with the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH.

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console, cd'ing to
the folder containing the py file and then running the py file from the
command line. The window will not close and you will be able to read any
error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Examine the file visually and check to see that it follows the rules mentioned
above. If all else fails, start over with the supplied config file and make
sure that it works, Then make your edits one by one to identify the problem.
