Jaime-

I just saw your post where you mentioned that you didn't know what to do the the previous version of my Cousins script. Well, that means you won't know how to use the finished script either- so...
Here goes-

I assume that you're using Windows, if not, I haven't tested my script on MacOS, so stop here. Someone needs to lend me a Mac so I can release my utilities for the Mac as well.

The instructions assume you are using RM v9. I haven't tested on other versions.

It's very important that you have backups of your database saved in safe location and that this utility not be run on your main database (at least initially or until you have confidence in it.)

Once this is set up, you'll be able to update the group with one double click.

Go to my website https://richardotter.github.io and find the line:
RootsMagic Group creator utility: “GroupFromSQL”

Click the header link and it will show a page at Github.
On that page, find the line:
GroupFromSQL.v1.1.0.0.zip

Click the link and it will download a zip file to your computer.
Save it your usual downloads folder, or wherever (as long as you know the location)

Get the unifuzz64.dll from the SQLiteToolsforRootsMagic website at this link:
https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unifuzz64.dll

Click the link and save the file to the downloads folder.

I have attached to this post a customized configuration file for your use -
it is called "custom RM-Python-config.ini.txt"

Click the link and do a Save to your Downloads folder.

Now you have everything you need.

In Windows file explorer, open the Downloads folder and right click the zip file and select "Extract All..."
This will create a folder in the downloads folder with the same name as the zip file. It will open that folder showing another folder, again with the same name.
Let's call this last folder the "Working Folder".

Open the "Working Folder" and see the contents-
ReadMe.txt
RM-Python-config.ini
GroupFromSQL.exe
GroupFromSQL.py

Move the "unifuzz64.dll" from the downloads folder to the "Working Folder".

Move the "custom RM-Python-config.ini.txt" from the downloads folder to the "Working Folder".

Make a copy of you main database and copy it to the Working Folder.
(If you have any questions about making a copy of your database, you should
probably stop here and ask for help from a local person)

Rename the copy in the Working Folder to "TEST.rmtree"

(MAKE SURE that your original database is where it is supposed to be, and that you have a set of backups)

So now the Working Folder has these files-
ReadMe.txt
RM-Python-config.ini
GroupFromSQL.exe
GroupFromSQL.py
TEST.rmtree
unifuzz64.dll
custom RM-Python-config.ini




Rename the "RM-Python-config.ini" file to "original RM-Python-config.ini"

Rename the "custom RM-Python-config.ini.txt" file to "RM-Python-config.ini"

Now the Working Folder has these files-
ReadMe.txt
original RM-Python-config.ini
GroupFromSQL.exe
GroupFromSQL.py
TEST.rmtree
unifuzz64.dll
RM-Python-config.ini

Now we need to edit the RM-Python-config.ini file to make it work for your database.

Open Notepad and drag the RM-Python-config.ini file onto the open notepad window.

Find line 23. It should look like this-
SELECT 2361 AS C_StartPerson,

You want to carefully change the number 2361 to the RIN of the base person you want to run the utility on. The person whose cousins you want in the group. Say you want to use person with RIN =1
Edit the line to-
SELECT 1 AS C_StartPerson,

Don't change the spacing at the start of the line, just change the number.

NOW- double click the GroupFromSQL.exe file
A black console window will display and show the number of people in the group. The group name as specified in the ini file is-Cousins_spouses_spouseparents

Open the TEST database file in RM and confirm that the group membership is what you want.
