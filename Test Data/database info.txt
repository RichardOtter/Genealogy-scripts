File-
TestData-RMpython.rmtree
is the test database for testing the RM utilities.

TEST DATA SortDates test -format_v11 -dump -reduced.sql
is used to create  the RM database for Dat and SortDate testing.


They are not kept in git due to size and binary nature.
Instead SQL dump text files are in git.

For routine testing, see C:\Users\rotter\dev\Genealogy\Test Data\
for binary databases and full dumps files.


Typical workflow-
From an RM database:
TestData-RMpython -v11.rmtree
a sql dump file:
TestData-RMpython -v11 -FULL.sql
is created and then manually edited to create:
TestData-RMpython -v11 -REDUCED.sql
by removing:
    LDS temples  from PlaceTable(paces with ID <1000,  record 1-216 records)
    standard templates from SourceTemplateTable (templates with ID <1000, records 1-439)



For the v11 reduced dumps, left the first 5 records for Source templates
and the first 5 records for places (LDS temples).

For the v11 Date test data, also removed:
     witness roles
    --- not very determined process




To create the dump file from a RM database:
(database file must not be read-only)
(note sqlite3 wants forward slashes in paths)

\bin\SQLite\sqlite3
.open TestData-RMpython -v11.rmtree
.output "TestData-RMpython -v11 -FULL.sql"
.dump
.exit


To restore RM database from a dump.sql file:
Determine the new rmtree file name first.

\bin\SQLite\sqlite3
.open "TestData-RMpython -v11 -FULL.rmtree"
.load "/Users/rotter/Genealogy/GeneDB/SW/SQLite extensions/unifuzz64.dll"
.read "TestData-RMpython -v11 -FULL.sql"
.exit

Open "TestData-RMpython -v11 -FULL.rmtree"
in RM and rebuild indexes and exit.
Make the file read only and then
make a copy for normal use.
