File-
TestData-RMpython.rmtree
is the test database for testing the RM utilities.

To avoid adding a large binary file to git, 
a sql dump file:
TestData-RMpython-FULL.sql
is created and then manually edited to create
TestData-RMpython-REDUCED.sql
by removing:
    LDS temples  from PlaceTable(paces with ID <1000,  record 1-216 records)
    standard templates from SourceTemplateTable (templates with ID <1000, records 1-439)

For now, only TestData-RMpython-REDUCED.sql is checked into git.
And testing will be done on the original TestData-RMpython.rmtree
which has never been dumped-restored.
Need to gain more confidence in the process and use of reduced form.


Local files-
TestData-RMpython.rmtree
use for testing. Create normal RM backups for safekeeping.

TestData-RMpython-FULL.sql
SQL dump of full TestData-RMpython.rmtree

TestData-RMpython-REDUCED.sql
slimed down version as described above.




Test reduced form
Restored the reduced form and tested in RM v10.
Created a new place.
Added a new source template.
No obvious problems.


To create the dump file from the RM database:

\bin\sqlite3
.open TestData-RMpython-FULL.sql
.dump
.exit


To restore RM database from a dump.sql file:

\bin\sqlite3
.open TestData-RMpython-reduced.rmtree
.load "C:/Users/rotter/Genealogy/GeneDB/SW/unifuzz64.dll"
.read TestData-RMpython-REDUCED.sql
.exit

Open TestData-RMpython-reduced.rmtree in RM and rebuild indexes.
