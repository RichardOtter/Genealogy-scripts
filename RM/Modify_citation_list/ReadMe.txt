Changes the citation sort order
CitationSortOrder.py


Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software (https://RootsMagic.com) uses a SQLite relational
database (https://Sqlite.org) as its data storage file.

Access to the RM data file via third party tools is a major advantage RM
has over other genealogy project management applications.

This utility is part of a suite of utilities that has been written to
perform analysis or data modification not available within the RM application.
See https://RichardOtter.github.io

This software is written using the Python language (https://Python.org) and
is distributed as a text ".py" file along with a folder, RMpy, of common Python
code, called a python package. The user can simply open the file or package
files in a text editor to read all implementation details and access safety.

A Python py script file is executed using the Python language interpreter.
The interpreter is a separate piece of software easily installed on your 
computer.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

This utility will charge the order that citations are listed in the Edit Person
window for citations attached to Facts, Names and/or Persons. This may be helpful
while doing research in bringing the most important citations to the top of the list.
The new ordering of citations is not used in reports generated by RM.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file (or at least
have multiple known-good backups) until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with a RootsMagic v 10.0.5 database
using Python for Windows v3.13.4   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be
modified to work on a Macintosh with Python version 3 installed.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility".
It is in the form of a single text file with a "py" file name extension
(referred to, in this section, as "MainScriptFile.py"). The utility also
needs the Python package RMpy, which is a folder included in the distribution
zip file.

Most input to the utility is through the configuration file. The the default
name of the configuration file (called, hereinafter, the "config file") is
 "RM-Python-config.ini". It should be located in the same folder as the
 MainScriptFile py script file and the RMpy folder. At a minimum, the config
file gives the name and location of the database on which the utility operates.

One config file can be shared among other RM utilities in the suite. Each
utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see APPENDIX below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy the program files/folder from the downloaded zip file to
   the working folder.

*  Copy the sample config file  from the downloaded zip file to
   the working folder.

*  Edit the config file in the working folder to tell the utility what to
   do and where to do it.

*  Double click the main program .py file to run the utility.

*  A window titled "Command Prompt" with a black background and white text will
appear. Some utilities will keep this window open and request commands and 
information, other utilities will only show the window for a moment, others 
will have the window displayed for the length of the utility's processing time.

*  The terminal window will close and a summary report will be displayed
in NotePad.

The above procedure of making a copy of your database and operating on it in 
the working folder is most prudent when a user is just getting familiar with 
a new or updated utility. 
Some utilities are read only and do not change the database at all, while others
affect only small amount of data. Once the user has confidence in the operation
of such a low-impact utility, one can start operating directly on the research
(production) database, always assuming that at least several known-good backups
exist.
Other utilities that involve more configuration and make larger chnages should
always be copied and operated on in a working folder.

*****  Details follow below. *****


=========================================================================DIV80==
Running the utility in detail

==========-
Create a folder on your computer that you will not confuse with other
folders- the "working folder".

==========-
Copy these items from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      CitationSortOrder.py             (file)
      RM-Python-config.ini             (file)
      RMpy                             (folder)

==========-
Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.

Rename the database copy to "TEST.rmtree" in order to prevent any
confusion about the purpose of the copy.

==========-
Edit the sample RM-Python-config.ini file in the working folder.
(See the section "APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing"
if you need help)

A summary of the config file structure:
The names in square brackets are section names.
The items in a section are key-value pairs.

For example, in the sample config file, there is a section named 
[FILE_PATHS].
In that section, reside 3 key-value pairs, one of which is 
DB_PATH = TEST.rmtree

"DB_PATH" is the key, "TEST.rmtree" is the value.
key-value pairs are separated with a = character.


The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
report file name and its location.

If you followed the above instructions, no changes to any of the key-values in
the [FILE_PATHS] section are needed.

Save the config file but leave it open in Notepad.

=========-
Open the TEST.rmtree in RootsMagic and find the citation list that is to be
reordered. Having the database open in RM for reference will aid the next steps.

=========-
Double click the CitationSortOrder.py file in the working folder to start
the utility.

=========-
A terminal window will open and prompt you asking for the RIN (PersonID) of the
person that has the attached citation list.
The utility will continue with prompts until the desired list of citations is
displayed. The user then responds to prompts until the list is ordered in the
desired way. 

=========-
The terminal window is closed and the utility is exited.

=========-
The report file is displayed in Notepad.

=========-
Return to the RootsMagic application window. Navigate away from the changed
citation listing and the return to it. Examine the modified sort order.

=========-
Consider whether to rename TEST.rmtree and use it as your research database.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Notes

=========-
CitationSortOrder can change the sort order for citations attached to Person,
Names, and Facts.
Currently, this utility will not change the sort order of citations attached to
Tasks, Marriages & Associations.
Those capabilities could be added.
This utility only changes the database table: CitationLinkTable and within
it, only the SortOrder column..

=========-
Due to lack of support in the RM app, the modified sort order is not utilized
in the "slide in workflow" for facts or in reports generated by RM.

=========-
An attractive complement to this utility is a SQL statement written by Tom Holden
with additions by Jerry Bryan. Their SQL does a global re-ordering of citations.
see:
https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/forum/topic/sorting-the-order-of-rm9-citations/

The concept is that all citations list are sorted by the same absolute criteria.
There are many options available. My choice of criteria was to sort the citations
by the Source Name. The resulting listing are a bit arbitrary, but at
least consistent.
And, as a bonus, Tom wrote his script so as not to override manual sorting done by
this utility.

=========-
Note that after reordering, newly added citations will appear at the top
of the list as they will have a SortOrder number of 0.
This contrasts with behavior seen before reordering where the citations are shown
in "order entered" sequence because all records are added with a SortOrder number of 0.
Use this app to make desired changes.

=========-
Updating the sort order of a set of citations while the database is open in
RM works OK. However, the citation lists do not have a refresh button, so,
you'll need to navigate away from the modified sort order citation list and then
return to it to see the new sort order.

=========-
This utility is using an undocumented feature of the RootsMagic application.
It is possible that a future release of RootsMagic may ignore the changes made
by this utility. It may also be possible, but unlikely, that a future RM
release may not work with a database whose citation sort order has been changed
with this utility. Fortunately, all changes made by this utility can be reverted by
a single, simple SQL update statement.

To revert all citation sort order modifications made by this utility, simply
change the sort order column to all zeros.

UPDATE CitationLinkTable SET SortOrder = 0;

This will change the sort order in RM v10 to "order entered", which is
the default.


=========================================================================DIV80==
APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
A file named "RM-Python-config.ini" will be recognized as the utility's 
configuration file when placed in the same directory as the Python 
script (.py file) for the utility. Each utility is distributed with a sample 
config file to get started.

Alternatively, the configuration file name and location can be specified
on the command-line as an argument to the script. This argument overrides
the default configuration file name and location.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default.

Note also that the file name is not restricted to the default.
For instance, running the utility as:
RMutility.py config_mine.ini
will instruct the utility to use config_mine.ini in the current directory
as its configuration file.

A configuration file that is used from the command line can be renamed so as
to convey its purpose. 
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described srciptname
with config file name argument to allow execution from the desktop with a
double mouse click.


Editing
Use any text editor to edit the configuration file. The Windows built-in
app "Notepad" is suitable.
To edit the configuration file, first open the Notepad app and then use the
mouse to drag the configuration file onto the open Notepad window.
(Becasue by default, files with the .ini extension are not associated with an
editor program.)


Format and conventions
The file uses the standard ini file format. The config file is made up of the
elements: Sections, Keys, Values and Comments.

A name in square brackets is a section name that identifies the start
of a section. A section continues until a new section starts. The order of 
sections is a config file is not important, but all of the sample config files
 start with the [FILE_PATHS] section.

A section contains one or more key-value pairs and comment lines. Every key 
should be in a named section.

A name on the left side of a "=" sign is a key.
Text on the right side of a "=" is the value assigned to the key on the left.
Comment lines start with a "#" character and are only included to help 
the user read and understand the file. They are ignored by the utility software.

For an example, here is a section containing 3 key-values used by all of the 
RM utilities:

[FILE_PATHS]
# this is the test database
DB_PATH         = TEST.rmtree
REPORT_FILE_PATH  = ..\Report_utilName.txt
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP  = C:\Windows\system32\Notepad.exe

The 3 keys, DB_PATH, REPORT_FILE_PATH, and REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP are all
in the [FILE_PATHS] section. The utility requires that their values be file 
paths, as shown.
The second line is a comment.

The file path may be absolute, as in REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP above, or it may
be relative to the current directory, as in DB_PATH and REPORT_FILE_PATH above.

The DB_PATH points to the database that is to be analyzed/modified.
See the sections "Backups" and "Running the utility in detail", above, for help
in deciding which database to use. New users will always want to point to a
copy of the main database.

The utilities all generate a textual report file. The file's name
and location can be specified by REPORT_FILE_PATH key.

If REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP key has a valid value, then the report file will be
automatically displayed by the named application.


Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented ä in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

APPENDIX  Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the terminal window for error messages
that will help you fix the problem. There may be something wrong with the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH.

If the terminal windows displays the message: RM-Python-config.ini file contains
a format error, see the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console, cd'ing to
the folder containing the py file and then running the py file from the
command line. The window will not close and you will be able to read any
error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
Examine th efile visually and chek to see that it follows the rules mentioned
above. If all else fails, start over with the supplied config file and make
sure that it works, Then make your edits one by one to identify the problem.
