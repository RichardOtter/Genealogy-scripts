List all citations for a person given the RIN/PersonID
ListCitationsForPersonID

Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third part tools is a major advantage
to using RM.
This software accesses that database directly to provide functionality not found
in the RootsMagic program.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

Generates  an alphabetically sorted list of source names and citation names
associated with a person. The list includes citations attached-

    to the specified person
    to facts attached to the person
    to facts shared to the person
    to names attached to the person
    to "family" objects that the person is in
    to facts attached to "family" objects that the person is in
    to associations that the person is a member of

the output also includes the number of citations found.

The results are saved to a report file which is automatically displayed.

Backups

IMPORTANT
This script only reads the database file and makes no changes.
However, you should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the the database
remains intact after use. At that point, run this utility of your
"production" database.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic v 10
Tested with Python for Windows v3.13   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.


======================================================================
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". 
To install and use the script:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
        ListCitationsForPersonID.py
        RM-Python-config.ini
        RMpy

   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.
   
   The config file also tells the utility what actions to perform.
    If you followed the above instructions, no edits are needed.

*  Double click the ListCitationsForPersonID.py file. This displays the
    black command console window.

*  Enter the RIN for the desired report and hit the Enter key. The command 
    window is closed.

*  Examine the generated report text file that is now opened in Notepad.

Input is a single RIN number (also called a PersonID).
The RIN can be entered at the console window as the script runs, or it can be 
specified in the RM-Python-config.ini file.

======================================================================
Backups

IMPORTANT: This utility ONLY reads the RM database file. This utility cannot
change your RM file. However, until you trust that this statement is true,
you should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have several known-good backups.


======================================================================
Getting Started

To install and use the exe single file version:

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Copy these files from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      ListCitationsForPersonID.exe
      RM-Python-config.ini

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Edit the config file in the working folder to specify the location of the RM
   database file. If you've followed the above suggestions, no editing is required.
   Editing the config file can be done using the Windows NotePad app.
   Open Notepad and drag the config file into the open NotePad window.

*   Double click the ListCitationsForPersonID.exe file. This displays the
    black command console window.

*  Enter the RIN for the desired report and hit the Enter key. The command 
    window is closed.

*  Examine the generated report text file that is now opened in Notepad.

Python install-

Either install Python from the Microsoft Store
or download and install from Python.org web site

From Microsoft Store
Run a command in Windows by pressing the keyboard key combination
"Windows + R", then in the small window, type Python.
Windows store will open in your browser and you will be be shown
the various versions of Python.
Click the Get button for the latest version.

Web site download and install
Download the current version of Python 3, ( or see direct link below
for the current as of this date)
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

Click on the link near the top of page. Then ...
Find the link near bottom left side of the page, in the "Stable Releases"
section, labeled "Download Windows installer (64-bit)"
Click it and save the installer.

Direct link to recent (as of 2024-12) version installer-
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-amd64.exe

The Python installation requires about 100 Mbytes.
It is easily and cleanly removed using the standard method found in
Windows=>Settings

Run the Python installer selecting all default options.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The RM-Python-config.ini file will be recognized as the configuration file when
placed in the same directory as the Python script (.py file) for the utility.
The file uses the standard ini file format.

The configuration file name and location can also be specified on the command-line
as an argument to the script. This argument overrides the default configuration
file located in the current directory if it exists.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file 
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default
Note that the file name is also not restricted to the default. 
For instance, running the utility with:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\Rmine.ini"
will instruct the utility to read Rmine.ini for its configuration parameters.

The configuration file might be named so as to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described argument
to allow execution from the desktop with a double mouse click.

Contents
The config file is made up of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and
Comments. The names in square brackets are Section Names that identify the start
of a section. A Section contains Key = Value pairs. Names on the left of
the = sign are Keys. Text on the right side of the = is the Value of the Key.
Comment lines start with # and are only included to help the user read and
understand the file.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Troubleshooting:

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There may be something wrong with the config file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH

If the black console windows displays the message-
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
See the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
