Test database
updated to v10
made a change to template "_Ancestry Database-Single -L"
by adding field ANC_SRC_IDOLD
and adding the new field to the footnote sentence

In source  BRdb ANC US                  1910-1949    Consular Reports of Births  

I added a citation that has most fields filed, including the new field
my name; 25 September 1955; ; ; 27 January 2025; 444:999; citation

then another citation, but with new filed empty
second  but anc src empty; ; ; ; 27 January 2025; ; 

As expected, both citations had their footnote correctly working.

also as expected from bug, previously created citations have bad footnotes


Now fix it

_Ancestry Database-Single -L
_Ancestry Database-Single -L-NEW
