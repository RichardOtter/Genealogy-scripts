=========================================================================DIV80==
Version: 1.1.2
released in suite v1.0.2

Fixed a loss of function.
App now, again fixes sources and citations that have missing XML filed elements
due to them being created with a older template, before that field was added.
Symptom- 
Say a template T1, has 2 fields, F1 and F2
Some sources S1 and S2 are created using template T1.

Now the template T1 is changed by editing it to add a field, F3.
The T1 template also has its footnote sentence adjusted to use the new field F3.
The edited template T1 is now called T1'

Now some more sources, S3 and S4, are created using template T1'
The user entered text for field F3 in S3, but left field F3 blank in S4.

Looking at the footnotes displayed in RM that are generated from T1',
one sees that source S3 and S4 look as expected. The F3 in S3 shows the text that
was entered for F3, and in S4, the F3 prints as blank.

However the footnotes from S1 and S2 are unexpected. 
Those sources do not have data in field F3. In fact, they don't 
even have a field F3. Any reference to F3 in the footnote sentence, 
by "[F3]" will, in the footnote, print out as "[F3]" not as "" as expected.

To fix, this utility can add the empty field F3 to the existing source S1 and S2.

This can be accomplished by copying the Template T1' to T1'-copy.
The T1'-copy can have changes like better names, or no changes at all.
Just map all of the fields to themselves and run the utility.
Each source and citation will be checked for missing fields and fixed if necessary.
