Changes the citation sort order
CitationSortOrder

Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third part tools is a major advantage
to using RM.
This software accesses that database directly to provide functionality not found
in the RootsMagic program.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

This utility will charge the order that citations are listed in the Edit Person
window for citations attached to Facts, Names and/or Persons. This may be helpful
while doing research in bringing the most important citations to the top of the list.
The new ordering of citations is not used in reports generated by RM.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

IMPORTANT
This script only reads the database file and makes no changes.
However, you should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the the database
remains intact after use. At that point, run this utility of your
"production" database.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic v 10
Tested with Python for Windows v3.13   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". 
It is in the form of a single file with a "py" extension, referred to 
below, as "MainScriptFile.py".
Most input to the utility is through the configuration file and sometimes
the command line console window.
The the default name of the configuration file ("config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini"
and it should also be located in the same folder as the MainScriptFile py script.
At a minimum, the config gives the name and location of the database on
which to operate. One config file can be shared among my other RM utilities.
Each utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      file:    MainScriptFile.py
      folder:  RMpy
      file:    RM-Python-config.ini

*  Edit the config file, RM-Python-config.ini, that was copied into the working folder.

   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile.py ile to run the utility. 

*  A summary report will be displayed in NotePad.

*****  Details follow below. *****


NEEDS WORK


   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.

   If you followed the above instructions, no edits are needed.

*  Double click the CitationSortOrder.py file. This displays the black command
   console window.

*  The console window displays a prompt asking for the RIN
(PersonID) of the person that has the attached citation list.
The utility will continue with prompts until the desired list of citations is
displayed. The user then responds to prompts until the list is ordered in the
desired way. The utility will then close.

*  Return to the RootsMagic application window. Navigate away from the changed
citation listing and the return to it. Examine the modified sort order.

Running the utility in detail

==========-


=========================================================================DIV80==
Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The RM-Python-config.ini file will be recognized as the configuration file when
placed in the same directory as the Python script (.py file) for the utility.
The file uses the standard ini file format.

The configuration file name and location can also be specified on the command-line
as an argument to the script. This argument overrides the default configuration
file located in the current directory if it exists.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file 
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default
Note that the file name is also not restricted to the default. 
For instance, running the utility with:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\Rmine.ini"
will instruct the utility to read Rmine.ini for its configuration parameters.

The configuration file might be named so as to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described argument
to allow execution from the desktop with a double mouse click.

Contents
The config file is made up of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and
Comments. The names in square brackets are Section Names that identify the start
of a section. A Section contains Key = Value pairs. Names on the left of
the = sign are Keys. Text on the right side of the = is the Value of the Key.
Comment lines start with # and are only included to help the user read and
understand the file.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Notes

=========-
CitationSortOrder can change the sort order for citations attached to Person,
Names, and Facts.
Currently, this utility will not change the sort order of citations attached to
Tasks, Marriages & Associations.
Those capabilities could be added.
This utility only changes the database table: CitationLinkTable and within
it, only the SortOrder column..


=========-
Due to lack of support in the RM app, the modified sort order is not utilized
in the "slide in workflow" for facts or in reports generated by RM.


=========-
Use of this utility may be productively combined with the use of a global
re-ordering SQL script developed by Tom Holden and Jerry Bryan.
https://sqlitetoolsforrootsmagic.com/forum/topic/sorting-the-order-of-rm9-citations/


=========-
Note that after reordering, newly added citations will appear at the top
of the list as they will have a SortOrder number of 0.
This contrasts with behavior seen before reordering where the citations are shown
in "order entered" sequence because all records are added with a SortOrder number of 0.
Use this app to make desired changes.


=========-
Updating the sort order of a set of citations while the database is open in
RM works OK. However, the citation lists do not have a refresh button, so,
you'll need to navigate away from the modified sort order citation list and then
return to it to see the new sort order.


=========-
This utility is using an undocumented feature of the RootsMagic (RM) application.
It is possible that a future release of RootsMagic may ignore the changes made
by this utility. It may also be possible, but unlikely, that a future RM
release may not work with a database whose citation sort order has been changed
with this utility. Fortunately, all changes made by this utility can be reverted by
a single, simple SQL update statement.

To revert all citation sort order modifications made by this utility, simply
change the sort order column to all zeros.
UPDATE CitationLinkTable SET SortOrder = 0;
This will change the sort order in RM v10 to "order entered", which is
the default.

=========-
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP
Option to automatically open the report file in a display application.
The included ini sample file has this option activated and set to use Windows
NotePad as the display app. Your favorite editor may be substituted.
Automatic display can be deactivated by inserting a # character
at the start of the line.

Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There may be something wrong with the config file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH

If the black console windows displays the message-
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
See the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
