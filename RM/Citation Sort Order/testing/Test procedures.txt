Test Procedure : Change Citation Sort Order

Preliminaries
*	RMPy package needs testing- config file location, name, contents

Procedure
Initial test procedures will define app states called Setups, that will be used in later test procedures.

Configuration
DB	normal
report name	normal
display app		notepad
Start app in VSCode using control+ F5, using configuration
that adds config_testdata.ini as command line argument.
