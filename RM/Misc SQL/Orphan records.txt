This removes citation links only- not citations
Best to look at the list and figure out what's not being used anymore before deleting anything.

Cause- lack of referential integrity constraints in RM.

This select uses NOCASE

Phantom Citation Links

The issue of phantom citation links came up recently on the RM Online Community. A citation link becomes phantom for causes unknown if the object to which the citation links ceases to exist while the link itself continues to exist. Such phantom links are not cleaned up by RM's Clean Phantom Records tool.

I developed two scripts, one to identify such phantom citation links and the other to delete them. There is really nothing else you can do with such links other than to delete them. Attached are four files, two for RM7 and two for RM9. RM7's citation links are in the CitationTable itself while RM9's citation links are in the CitationLinkTable.

Phantom citation links are identified or deleted for individuals, for families, for events, and for names. In RM9, there can be citation links for tasks and for associations. But I don't use these RM features, so I made no attempt to address phantom links for tasks or for associations.
