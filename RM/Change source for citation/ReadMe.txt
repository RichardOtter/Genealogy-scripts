Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third part tools is a major advantage
to using RM.
This software accesses that database directly to provide functionality not found
in the RootsMagic program.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

RootsMagic has Sources and Citations. Sources are also called "Master Sources".
Citations are also called "Source Details".

Sources are created using a Source Template. If 2 sources are created
from the same source template, they will have the same fundamental structure.

A Citation is created as a child of a Source. Citations of different sources
created using the same source template will also have the same fundamental
structure.

This simple utility will move a citation from one source to another source,
but only if the 2 sources were created using the same source template.

For example, if you lump census source by US state and year, you will have a
number of sources all based on the same source template.
When entering a citation, you may accidentally cite a source set up for the
wrong year or state. Instead of deleting and recreating the citation, use this
utility to move the citation to the correct source.

Backups

IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic v 10
Tested with Python for Windows v3.13   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.

Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". 
It is in the form of a single file with a "py" extension, referred to 
below, as "MainScriptFile.py".
Most input to the utility is through the configuration file and sometimes
the command line console window.
The the default name of the configuration file ("config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini"
and it should also be located in the same folder as the MainScriptFile py script.
At a minimum, the config gives the name and location of the database on
which to operate. One config file can be shared among my other RM utilities.
Each utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      file:    MainScriptFile.py
      folder:  RMpy
      file:    RM-Python-config.ini

*  Edit the config file, RM-Python-config.ini, that was copied into the working folder.

   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile.py ile to run the utility. 

*  A summary report will be displayed in NotePad.

*****  Details follow below. *****

Running the utility in detail

==========-

=========================================================================DIV80==
Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The RM-Python-config.ini file will be recognized as the configuration file when
placed in the same directory as the Python script (.py file) for the utility.
The file uses the standard ini file format.

The configuration file name and location can also be specified on the command-line
as an argument to the script. This argument overrides the default configuration
file located in the current directory if it exists.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file 
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default
Note that the file name is also not restricted to the default. 
For instance, running the utility with:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\Rmine.ini"
will instruct the utility to read Rmine.ini for its configuration parameters.

The configuration file might be named so as to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described argument
to allow execution from the desktop with a double mouse click.

Contents
The config file is made up of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and
Comments. The names in square brackets are Section Names that identify the start
of a section. A Section contains Key = Value pairs. Names on the left of
the = sign are Keys. Text on the right side of the = is the Value of the Key.
Comment lines start with # and are only included to help the user read and
understand the file.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Notes

=========-


=========-
Information that the user enters in the command window is checked before
 it is used. It is unlikely that random data would be accepted by
 the utility.

=========-
The utility asks for the name of the citation to change and the source
that it should use. In both cases, only enough of the name needs to be
entered to make it unique among all citations for all sources. 
It is suggested that you copy and paste from the RM source edit window.
There is no need to manually type input.
One may start the name entry with a % char and it will be used as the
standard  'SQL Like' wild card.
If the full citation name is not unique, then as a workaround, you
could add some text to the citation name of the citation you want
to modify to make the name unique.

=========-
Checks made by the utility:
1- User is asked for the citation name of the citation to modify.
    a) the name must be found.
    b) the name must be unique among all citations for all sources.
   You will be made aware of problems.
2- User is asked for the source that is to be used as the new parent of
   the citation.
    a) the source name must be found.
    b) the source name must be unique.
    c) the existing source used by the citation and the new source
       specified must both use the same source template.
   You will be made aware of problems.

=========-
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

Option to automatically open the report file in a display application.
The included ini sample file has this option activated and set to use Windows
NotePad as the display app. It can be deactivated by inserting a # character
at the start of the line. Your favorite editor may be substituted.

Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There may be something wrong with the config file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH

If the black console windows displays the message-
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
See the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
