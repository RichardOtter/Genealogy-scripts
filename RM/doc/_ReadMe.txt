This zip file contains all of the current versions of 
all the released RootsMagic utility programs.

The collection of utilities has a version number and each of the utilities
has a separate version number (displayed in the report file header.)

If a utility is updated or a new one is created, a new collection (or suite)
with a new version number will be created and released on GitHub.


Note:
Code used by all of the utilities is contained in the Python package RMpy
This is the folder named RMpy in each of the utility folders.
The RMpy folder and its contents are exactly the same in each utility folder.
The folder has been copied to each solely as a convenience.
