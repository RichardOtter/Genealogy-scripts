Purpose

A RootsMagic database contains records for Sources and Citations. Sources are
also called "Master Sources". Citations are also called "Source Details".

Sources are created using a Source Template. If 2 sources are created
from the same source template, they will have the same fundamental structure.

A Citation is created as a child of a Source. Citations of different sources
created using the same source template will have the same fundamental
structure as each other.

This simple utility will move a citation from one source to another source,
but only if the 2 sources were created using the same source template.

For example, if you lump obituary sourced by newspaper, you will have a
number of sources (newspapers) all based on the same source template.
When entering a citation, you may accidentally cite a source set up for the
wrong newspaper. Instead of deleting and recreating the citation, use this
utility to move the citation to the correct source.

The utility will carry along all of the uses of the citation, along with web
links and media.

Running the utility in detail

While the database name and location is specified in the config file, the actual
instructions for which citations and sources to modify are entered at a series
of prompts in the black terminal window.

==========-
Create a folder on your computer that you will not confuse with other
folders- the "working folder".

==========-
Copy these items from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      ChangeSrcForCitation.py          (file)
      RM-Python-config.ini             (file)
      RMpy                             (folder)

==========-
Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.

Rename the database copy to "TEST.rmtree" in order to prevent any
confusion about the purpose of the copy.

==========-
Edit the sample RM-Python-config.ini file in the working folder.
(See the section "APPENDIX  Config file: location, contents and editing"
if you need help)

A summary of the config file structure:
The names in square brackets are section names.
The items in a section are key-value pairs.

So, for example, in the sample config file, there is a section named 
[FILE_PATHS].
In that section, reside 3 key =  value pairs, one of which is 
DB_PATH = TEST.rmtree
DB_PATH is the key, TEST.rmtree is the value.
key-value pairs are separated with a = character.


The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
report file name and its location.

If you followed the above instructions, no changes to any of the key-values in
the [FILE_PATHS] section are needed.

Save the config file but leave it open in Notepad.


=========-
Double click the "ChangeSrcForCitation.py" file in the working folder
to start the utility.

=========-
A terminal window will open and prompt you to enter the name of
the citation to move and the source that it should be moved to.

In both cases, only enough of the name needs to be
entered to make it unique among all citations for all sources.

It is suggested that you copy and paste from the RM source edit window.
There is no need to manually type input.

The standard 'SQL Like' wild card characters % and _ may be used.
% matches 0 or more characters, _ matches one character.
This utility silently adds a % to the end of the citation name  and
source name text entered.

=========-
After the source name is entered, either a confirmation or error message
is displayed.
In either case, a prompt to change another citation is shown. Respond with
either y or n.

=========-
If "n" is entered in response to the "Change another citation" prompt,
the terminal window is closed and the utility is exited.

=========-
The report file is displayed in Notepad for you inspection.

=========-
Open the TEST.rmtree database in RM and confirm the desired changes have
been accomplished.

=========-
Consider whether to rename TEST.rmtree and use it as your research database.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Notes

=========-
If the full citation name is not unique, then as a workaround, you
could add some text to the citation name of the citation you want
to modify to make the name unique.

=========-
All entered information is verified before it is used. It is unlikely that
random data would be accepted by the utility.

Checks made by the utility:
1- User is asked for the citation name of the citation to modify.
    a) the name must be found.
    b) the name must be unique among all citations for all sources.
   You will be made aware of problems.
2- User is asked for the source that is to be used as the new parent of
   the citation.
    a) the source name must be found.
    b) the source name must be unique.
    c) the existing source used by the citation and the new source
       specified must both use the same source template.
   You will be made aware of problems.
