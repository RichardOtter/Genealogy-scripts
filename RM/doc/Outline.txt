Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third part tools is a major advantage
to using RM.
This software accesses that database directly to provide functionality not found
in the RootsMagic program.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

=======================
large changes
VERY IMPORTANT
This utility makes changes to the RM database file. It can change a large number
of data items in a single run depending on the settings specified.
You will likely not be satisfied with your first run of the utility and you will
want to try again, perhaps several times, each time making changes to your
configuration file. 
You must run this script on a copy of your database file and have at least
multiple known-good backups.

Read about additional considerations in the Precautions section below.

=======================
small changes
IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.

=======================
read only
IMPORTANT
This script only reads the database file and makes no changes.
However, you should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the the database
remains intact after use. At that point, run this utility of your
"production" database.

=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic v 10
Tested with Python for Windows v3.13   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.

Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". 
It is in the form of a single file with a "py" extension, referred to 
below, as "MainScriptFile.py".
Most input to the utility is through the configuration file and sometimes
the command line console window.
The the default name of the configuration file ("config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini"
and it should also be located in the same folder as the MainScriptFile py script.
At a minimum, the config gives the name and location of the database on
which to operate. One config file can be shared among my other RM utilities.
Each utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      file:    MainScriptFile.py
      folder:  RMpy
      file:    RM-Python-config.ini

*  Edit the config file, RM-Python-config.ini, that was copied into the working folder.

   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile.py ile to run the utility. 

*  A summary report will be displayed in NotePad.

Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The RM-Python-config.ini file will be recognized as the configuration file when
placed in the same directory as the Python script (.py file) for the utility.
The file uses the standard ini file format.

The configuration file name and location can also be specified on the command-line
as an argument to the script. This argument overrides the default configuration
file located in the current directory if it exists.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file 
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default
Note that the file name is also not restricted to the default. 
For instance, running the utility with:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\Rmine.ini"
will instruct the utility to read Rmine.ini for its configuration parameters.

The configuration file might be named so as to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described argument
to allow execution from the desktop with a double mouse click.

Editing
Use any text editor to edit the configuration file. The builtin-to-Windows
app "Notepad" works well. 
To edit the configuration file, first open the Notepad app and then use the
mouse to drag the configuration file onto the open Notepad window

Contents
The config file is made up of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and
Comments. The names in square brackets are Section Names that identify the start
of a section. A Section contains Key = Value pairs. Names on the left of
the = sign are Keys. Text on the right side of the = is the Value of the Key.
Comment lines start with # and are only included to help the user read and
understand the file.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Running the utility in detail

==========-

below moved to Notes

Before starting, you will want to confirm that a group exists in your database
that will be the basis of the color operation. Make sure that you know the
exact spelling of the name and that there is only one group with that name.

Next, determine the color group that you wish to modify and the specific color 
number. To get the numbers, open the color coding window in RM. 
Looking at the "Current color code set" drop down menu at the top of the window,
the top-most item is set 1, the bottom is set 10. By default they are named
"Color code set 1"  etc.. If they have been renamed, you'll have to count.
Looking at the left hand column of colors, counting from the top color, Pink 
is 1, Slate is 27.

Next, determine whether there will be more than one action to perform. Usually,
if you want to make a group correspond to a color, you will want to reset/clear 
that color before assigning group members. This will take care of cases in which
people have been removed from groups.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Precautions before using the modified database

Once you are satisfied with the results of the modifications made by this
software, don't hurry to start use the resulting file for research.
Continue your work for a week or so using the original database to allow
further consideration. Then run the utility again with your perfected config
file on a new copy of your now-current database and then use the modified
database as your normal work file.
The week delay will give you time to think about it. If you start
using the newly modified database immediately, you'll lose work if you miss
a problem and have to revert to a backup.


=========================================================================DIV80==

NOTES sections

=========-
REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

Option to automatically open the report file in a display application.
The included ini sample file has this option activated and set to use Windows
NotePad as the display app. It can be deactivated by inserting a # character
at the start of the line. Your favorite editor may be substituted.

Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There may be something wrong with the config file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH

If the black console windows displays the message-
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
See the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
You may want to look at- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

===========-
Error Message:
Tried to create duplicate Name in XML.

This will be generated when the first source is processed. It is generated
before any database change is made.

This problem can usually be avoided by reordering the lines in the mapping.

Example:
CITATION_MAPPING =
  Field_1     >     Field_2
  Field_2     >     Field_1

In this case, existing field 1 is attempted to be renamed to field 2. However,
there is already an existing field 2. That is not allowed and will stop
processing and generate the error message.

This can be avoided by using a temporary field, say "temp"

CITATION_MAPPING =
  Field_1     >     temp
  Field_2     >     Field_1
  temp        >     Field_2
  temp        >     NULL


=========-
Multiline Values
Probably the trickiest part of the config file is the COLORS key in OPTIONS.
It may be assigned either a single or multi line value.
Each line of the value should be on a separate line indented with at least 
one blank. An empty line generates an error.
Multi-line values may not contain comment lines (lines starting with a #).

examples-

correct formats-

COLOR_COMMAND = GroupName1

COLOR_COMMAND =
  GroupName1

COLOR_COMMAND = GroupName1
  GroupName2
  GroupName3

COLOR_COMMAND =
  GroupName1
  GroupName2
  GroupName3


incorrect format- (empty line not allowed)

COLOR_COMMAND =
  GroupName1

  GroupName2
  GroupName3


incorrect format (not indented)

COLOR_COMMAND =
GroupName1
GroupName2
GroupName3

incorrect format (no commented lines in the multi line value)

COLOR_COMMAND =
  GroupName1
 #  GroupName2
  GroupName3
