Group persons by using SQL
GroupFromSQL

Utility application for use with RootsMagic databases

RootsMagic (RM) software uses a SQLite relational database as its data storage
file. Having access to that file via third part tools is a major advantage
to using RM.
This software accesses that database directly to provide functionality not found
in the RootsMagic program.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Purpose

This utility uses SQL to query the database file and create a RM group in the
RM database independently of RM. Groups may be created with RootsMagic software,
of course, but the types of queries are much more limited.

This utility will update one or more RM groups from any SQL query that returns
a list of RINs/PersonIDs.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Backups

IMPORTANT
This utility modifies the RM database file.
You should run this script on a copy of your database file or at least
have multiple known-good backups until you are confident that the changes made
are the ones desired.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Compatibility

Tested with RootsMagic v 10
Tested with Python for Windows v3.13   64bit

The py file has not been tested on MacOS but could probably be easily
modified to work on MacOS with Python version 3 installed.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Overview

This program is what is called a "command line utility". 
It is in the form of a single file with a "py" extension, referred to 
below, as "MainScriptFile.py".
Most input to the utility is through the configuration file and sometimes
the command line console window.
The the default name of the configuration file ("config file") is "RM-Python-config.ini"
and it should also be located in the same folder as the MainScriptFile py script.
At a minimum, the config gives the name and location of the database on
which to operate. One config file can be shared among my other RM utilities.
Each utility will extract the information it needs from the config file.

To install and use the script for the first time:

*  Install Python for Windows x64  -see immediately below

*  Create a new folder on your disk.
   This will be called the "working folder".

*  Make a copy of your database, move the copy into the working folder.
   Rename the copy to TEST.rmtree

*  Copy these files and the folder from the downloaded zip file to the working folder-
      file:    MainScriptFile.py
      folder:  RMpy
      file:    RM-Python-config.ini

*  Edit the config file, RM-Python-config.ini, that was copied into the working folder.

   The utility needs to know where the RM database file is located, the output
   report file name and its location.

*  Double click the MainScriptFile.py ile to run the utility. 

*  A summary report will be displayed in NotePad.

*****  Details follow below. *****


=========================================================================DIV80==
Running the utility in detail

==========-
*  Create or find a SQL statement that returns the RINs of the people you want
   to put into a group.


For example-

[OPTIONS]
GROUP_NANE = GroupEveryone

#-----------------------------------------------
[GroupEveryone]
SQL_QUERY = SELECT PersonID FROM PersonTable

#-----------------------------------------------

Shown are two sections: "OPTIONS" and "GroupEveryone".

Section "OPTIONS" has one key :"GROUP_NAME" which has the value "GroupEveryone".

Section "GroupEveryone" has one key: "SQL_QUERY" which has the
value "SELECT PersonID FROM PersonTable".

This example, if run with the utility, will update the group GroupEveryone, already 
existing in the database, using the SQL statement show.
The example SQL_QUERY is very simple and fits on the same line as the key name.
Real SQL will be much more complex and require multiple lines.
Each line of a multi line Value must be indented at least one space.

for example:

SQL_QUERY =
   --
   -- selects person whose married name starts with 'sm'
   SELECT pt.personid
   FROM persontable AS pt
   INNER JOIN nametable AS nt ON pt.personid = nt.ownerid
   WHERE nt.nametype = 5    -- married name
   AND nt.surname LIKE 'sm%'

The SQL_QUERY key specifies the SQL statement that will be run.
It must return a set of PersonID's. The statement may begin on the next line,
as above, as long as the SQL lines are all
indented with white space. Blank lines are not allowed.
Use indented SQL comments (--) to add spacing for readability.
# style comments are not allowed in multi line values.


The Group_name value in OPTIONS may also have multiple lines, that is
multiple group names. Each of those group will be updated in the same run
of the utility.

Your config file can contain multiple Sections each with SQL statements.
Only the Sections specified by [OPTIONS] GROUP_NANE will be used. The others
are ignored.


=========================================================================DIV80==
Config file: location, contents and editing

Name and location
The RM-Python-config.ini file will be recognized as the configuration file when
placed in the same directory as the Python script (.py file) for the utility.
The file uses the standard ini file format.

The configuration file name and location can also be specified on the command-line
as an argument to the script. This argument overrides the default configuration
file located in the current directory if it exists.

For example, if the script "RMutility.py" is executed from the folder
"C:\Users\me\Joe", it will use the configuration file 
 C:\Users\me\Joe\RM-Python-config.ini" if it exists.
However, if the utility is run with an explicit argument, such as:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\RM-Python-config.ini"
then the specified configuration file will be used instead of the default
Note that the file name is also not restricted to the default. 
For instance, running the utility with:
  RMutility.py "C:\Users\me\Joe\documents\Rmine.ini"
will instruct the utility to read Rmine.ini for its configuration parameters.

The configuration file might be named so as to convey its purpose.
A Windows shortcut can also be constructed with the above described argument
to allow execution from the desktop with a double mouse click.

Contents
The config file is made up of the elements: Sections, Keys, Values and
Comments. The names in square brackets are Section Names that identify the start
of a section. A Section contains Key = Value pairs. Names on the left of
the = sign are Keys. Text on the right side of the = is the Value of the Key.
Comment lines start with # and are only included to help the user read and
understand the file.

Encoding
If there are any non-ASCII characters in the config file then the file must be
saved in UTF-8 format, with no byte order mark (BOM).
The included sample config file has an accented Ã¤ in the first line comment to
force it to be in the correct format.
File format is an option in the "Save file" dialog box in NotePad.

Notes

=========-
This utility will not help you write the SQL statement and is not a good
working environment in which to create your SQL statement.
Confirm you query works before running it in this utility. (Or get the SQL from
a source that has confirmed its results. This app is written so that incorrect
SQL will not damage your database, only give groups with unwanted members.)
It is suggested that you write and debug your SQL in a GUI SQLite manager app,
such as "SQLite Expert Personal", the 64bit version, a free app. Several others
are also available.

Note that the SQL statement is run in an environment that does not have the
RMNOCASE collation used by RM for most name type columns. Use "COLLATE NOCASE"
to avoid errors.

=========-
Also remember, that groups in RM, are always groups of Persons. So if you want
to find all RM facts with a certain characteristic, you need to create a group of
the people that have that fact attached. Once the group is created, you will
need to search each person's edit window for the fact you are interested in.

=========-
Due to technical issue regarding RMNOCASE, this utility will not actually create a
new group. Instead use RM to create the group name before using this utility.
The process is simple-
Open the database in RM,
Click the Command palette icon in the top right corner of the RM window.
Type "Group" and select the "Groups" command.
In the Add New Group window, type the name of the new group and hit Save.
Be sure the name is unique among group names.
Leave the Type set to "Simple" as is the default.

The same Add New Group window can be accessed by clicking the large plus icon in
the groups tab in the "Side View" which by default is on the left.

=========-
Updating the contents of a group while the database is open in RM works OK.
However, RM lists using group (simple style) filters do not have a refresh button,
so, for example, if you displaying People view filtered by the group that has been
updated, you'll need to switch to another group and then back again to see the
effect of the group having been updated.

=========-
On some occasions, the utility report file will display a "Database
Locked" message. In that case, close RM and re-run the utility, then re-open 
RM. It's not clear why this sometimes happens, but it is rare. 
For some reason, RM keeps an open transaction which prevents other processes
from making updates.
No database damage has ever been seem after many hundreds of uses. 
"Database locked" is a normal message encountered from SQLite.

Less important notes.

=========-
I have not tested all SQL statements :)
The utility takes the input SQL and creates a temporary view based on it. If that
fails, an appropriate error is returned. That should protect against SQL that
modifies/deletes data. (This is not tested beyond simple cases.)

=========-
This utility will, if so configured, modify a pre-existing group that may be
important to you. Take care when assigning the group name: [OPTIONS] GROUP_NAME.

=========-
This utility only changes the GroupsTable in the database

=========-
This utility creates a temporary view named: PersonIdList_RJO_utils and
deletes it when done.

=========-
(For testing) To create a "database locked" situation, start a transaction
in an external SQLite tool, try to run this utility. Will get locked message 
until transaction in SQLite Expert is either committed or RolledBack.

Troubleshooting

=========-
No Report File displayed

If the report is created, but not displayed, check the config
file line- REPORT_FILE_DISPLAY_APP

If no report file is generated, look at the black command
console window for error messages that will help you fix the problem.
There may be something wrong with the config file line- REPORT_FILE_PATH

If the black console windows displays the message-
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error
See the section below.

If no report file is generated and the black command console window closes
before you can read it, try first opening a command line console and then
running the py file from the command line. The window will not close
and you'll be able to read any error messages.

=========-
Error message:
RM-Python-config.ini file contains a format error

Start over with the supplied config file and make sure that works, Then make your
edits one by one to identify the problem.
You may want to look at- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file

=========-
Multiline Values
Probably the trickiest part of the config file is the GROUP_NAME key.
It may be assigned either a single or multi line value.
Each line of the value should be on a separate line indented with at least 
one blank. An empty line generates an error.
Multi-line values may not contain comment lines (lines starting with a #).

examples-

correct formats-

GROUP_NAME = GroupName1

GROUP_NAME =
  GroupName1

GROUP_NAME = GroupName1
  GroupName2
  GroupName3

GROUP_NAME =
  GroupName1
  GroupName2
  GroupName3


incorrect format- (empty line not allowed)

GROUP_NAME =
  GroupName1

  GroupName2
  GroupName3


incorrect format (not indented)

GROUP_NAME =
GroupName1
GroupName2
GroupName3

incorrect format (no commented lines in the multi line value)

GROUP_NAME =
  GroupName1
 #  GroupName2
  GroupName3
